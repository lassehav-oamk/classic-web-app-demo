# Classic Web App Demo

This repository contains two demos of classic web applications and their logic. From user viewpoint both
applications are identical, but the logic behind them is different. Both applications work as a diary app
that allows the user to add diary entries.

The first demo is a classic web application that uses server-side rendering. The second demo introduces AJAX
concept, which means Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX allows the web application to communicate with the
server without reloading the whole page. This makes the application faster and more user-friendly. The second demo
uses plain JavaScript in the browser.
