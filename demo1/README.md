# Diary application with server-side rendering only

This repository contains a classic web application that uses server-side rendering and logic only. The application works as a diary app that allows the user to add diary entries.

The application is built with Node.js and Express. The application uses server-side rendering only, which means that the server generates the HTML and sends it to the browser. The browser does not have any logic, it only displays the HTML.

The data is stored in memory, which means that the data is lost when the server is restarted.
