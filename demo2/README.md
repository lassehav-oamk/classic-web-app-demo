# Diary application demonstration with logic in client side as well

This repository contains a simple web application that demonstrates how client side javascript is used to implement UI modifications. The application works as a diary app that allows the user to add diary entries.

Client side JS is used to load data from the server with HTTP calls and to store the information given by user to the server. The server side is implemented with Node.js and Express. The server side is responsible for storing the data and serving it to the client side.
